# Employee-s-turnover-cost
In this repository I have analyzed a dataset containing data from a company. Using Python (and some of its libraries such us pandas, scikit-learn, numpy among others) through Google Colab I was able to understand what were the key points of the problems themselves looking for a solution that would help the company to save thousands of euros in the process of hiring new staff. 
Subsequently, I made a [dashboard in Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/shared/QPXYK3S26?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to present it to the director of the company.
